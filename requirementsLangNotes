all things are equal, tries to find boundries between spacies, everyting is a paramterized space that can be transformed into any other space

informal descriptive language

human and computer engage in conversation

as rules are added invariants are stored
when a rules is added that violates a previoulsy held invariant a converastion ensure between rule set and user

a model of a system will output a set of invariants, two models describing the same phenomena will support different invarints, exploring where the pivot points are between the invariants; transofrming the invariant into a query and then posing that query to the other model or the external universe to glue or melt models together

spec lang
- describe variables + user provided variables
- conditional actions over those variables
- perform beadth first search over all potential transitions
- allow user to define invariants; querey about what sequence of events a system must reach before achieving a pattern amtched state; capute error states
- make user aware of cases they hadnt considered (as states are explored, compress or pattern match and categorize states)
